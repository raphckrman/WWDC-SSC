This project was created for the **Apple Swift Student Challenge**, but also because I personally needed it. Although the app is limited in functionality—designed to be presentable within just a few minutes—it is intended to **evolve over time**. It’s a **study app** that leverages flashcards, the **Leitner system**, and various **algorithms**. However, most existing apps on the market are **slow**, **unattractive**, **cluttered with ads**, or **unavailable offline**.
